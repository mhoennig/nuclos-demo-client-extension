Experimental code to explore how to build Nuclos client extensions
which have access to other field values and the surrounding entity instance.

It turned out that Nuclos is lacking some API functionality, thus this demo contains 
some really really ugly code as a workaround until such an API is available;
therefore it also functions as a suggestion of what's needed in real workd applications.

Build directions:

- tested with JDK 7 (JDK 8 not yet fully supported by Nuclos)
- mvn install
- remove previous version from [WHEREVER]/Nuclos/extensions/client
- copy ext-client/target/client-extensions-demo-*-SNAPSHOT.jar to [WHEREVER]/Nuclos/extensions/client
- reinstall Nuclos
- optionally clear local javaws caches
